**Structure of the Results Section: A Guide for Academic Report Writing**

The results section is a crucial part of any academic report, as it presents the findings of a study in an objective and clear manner. In this video, we will discuss the importance of the results section and provide guidance on how to structure it.

**Why is the Results Section Important?**

* The results section reports the findings of a study without subjective interpretation.
* It demonstrates your contribution to the field by presenting research-based information.
* Effective presentation and organization are essential for engaging academic readers and communities.

**Organizing a Results Section: Key Points to Consider**

1. **Presenting Results in Order of Research Questions or Hypothesis**: Provides clarity for both the reader and yourself.
2. **Dividing into Themes and Subthemes**: Makes it easier to structure your results section and communicate findings effectively.
3. **Arranging Results Logically**: Follows certain logistics, ensuring a clear flow of information.
4. **Contribution to the Study's Objective**: Ensures that each part of the result section serves a purpose.

**Example: Structuring the Results Section**

* Overview Paragraph:
	+ Clearly states the main findings (e.g., "We show that...").
	+ Cites relevant sections or studies
* Subsection of Result:
	+ Provides specific details about the finding (e.g., "As the first step, we show...")
	+ Supports with evidence from other sections

**Best Practices for Writing a Results Section**

1. **Report findings objectively**: Avoid subjective interpretation.
2. **Use clear and concise language**: Make it easy to understand for both you and your readers.
3. **Divide into themes and subthemes**: Organize results in a logical manner.
4. **Keep each part brief**: Save detailed analysis for the discussion section.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively structure your results section and communicate your research findings clearly to academic audiences.

**Structuring Your Results Section: A Step-by-Step Guide**

In today's video, we discussed the importance of structuring your results section effectively and provided guidance on how to do so.

**Key Components of a Well-Structured Results Section**

1.  **Background Information**: Clearly state the research question or hypothesis.
2.  **Presentation of Data**: Use visual aids like tables, figures, or charts to present data in an easy-to-understand format.
3.  **Data Elaboration**: Provide explanations and supporting details for each finding.
4.  **Commenting on Results**: Compare findings with the research question or hypothesis.
5.  **Reporting Anomalies**: Identify any unusual patterns or results.

**Example: Stating Structure and Providing Background**

To start your results section, you can write a sentence like this:

"To evaluate the effects of missing data and imputation strategies on model fairness and performance, we explore the experimental data aligned to the three main factors of the experimental design..."

This provides background information for your research findings.

**Example: Presenting Results with Propositions**

When presenting results, use propositions that clearly state what you've found:

"Clearly, a strongly popular partition is also popular and a popular partition, interpreted as a probability distribution with singleton support, is mixed popular."

These propositions are supported by citations to relevant studies or literature.

**Example: Commenting on Data**

To comment on your data, explain why certain findings are significant:

"There is also a notable increase in outliers. Whilst neither of these observations is surprising, that different imputation strategies appear to affect specific performance and fairness metrics differently is."

This commentary provides context for the significance of the results.

**Connecting Research Question to Findings**

Finally, connect your research question to the findings by stating how they relate:

"Overall, considering the first part of the research question posed (whether the imputation strategy affects the fairness and the performance of a machine learning model), an initial inspection of the distribution of performance and fairness outcomes visualized in Figures 1 and 2 suggests that..."

By following these guidelines, you can effectively structure your results section.

**Using Figures and Tables Effectively in Academic Reports**

In academic reports, figures and tables play a crucial role in presenting data in a clear and concise manner, facilitating comprehension for readers.

**Key Benefits of Using Figures and Tables:**

*   **Improved Clarity**: Visual aids like tables and figures help explain complex processes or relationships between variables.
*   **Logical Organization**: Organizing data into structured formats makes it easier to analyze and understand.
*   **Effective Communication**: Presenting findings in a clear, concise manner enhances communication with the academic community.

**Two Approaches to Describing Figures and Tables:**

1.  **Reporting Figures or Tables:** This approach describes the figure or table without comment, leaving room for interpretation by the reader.
    *   Example: "Figure 2.1 explains the correlation between smoking and hypertension in adult females."
2.  **Interpreting Figures or Tables:** This approach provides explicit meaning associated with the data, guiding readers through their understanding of the results.

**Enhancing Presentation with Data Sets:**

*   Using charts to illustrate connections between variables
*   Highlighting key findings from datasets

By incorporating figures and tables effectively into academic reports, writers can improve clarity, organization, and communication, ultimately facilitating comprehension among readers.

**Best Practices for Writing Effective Results Sections**

Writing a clear and concise results section is crucial in scientific research reports. Here are key points to consider:

###  **Tense Selection: Past vs. Present**

*   Use the past tense when reporting data, as it provides an objective account of events.
    *   Example: "In brief, more than 60 percent of students born after 2000 faced mental stress in their teens."
*   Employ the present tense to interpret and describe tables, emphasizing the significance of findings.
    *   Example: "Table 2.2 illustrates the income difference between students from international schools and normal private schools."

### **Personal vs. Impersonal Style**

*   Generally, use an impersonal style in scientific writing, where data sets are presented without personal opinions or biases.
    *   Example: "This phenomenon reflects the need for a robust framework to develop biliteracy among school children."
*   However, experts and established authors may employ a personal style when reporting results that require subjective interpretation or argumentation.

### **Avoiding Adjectives**

*   Refrain from adding unnecessary adjectives or value judgments to data descriptions.
    *   Example: Instead of "Most interestingly," simply state the observation without emphasis.

*   **Structure:** The discussion section is typically divided into three paragraphs:
    *   Introductory paragraph: Outlines the results, provides supporting evidence, and explains its relation to the findings.
    *   Intermediate paragraph: Offers a comprehensive interpretation of key findings, comments on shortcomings, and analyzes unexpected results.
    *   Concluding paragraph: Summarizes the discussion, highlights connections between research hypothesis and findings, discusses rationale, mentions scope for future research
*   **Purpose:** The purpose is to provide analysis and interpretation of the research findings.

Here is a concise summary capturing key takeaways from the video on structuring the discussion section:

**Components:**

1.  **Summary**: Summarizes key findings, analyzes their relation to research questions and hypothesis.
2.  **Context**: Provides background information to understand the significance of research in its respective field.
3.  **Analysis & Interpretation of Findings**: Examines how results align with existing literature and explores unexpected outcomes.

**Key Points:**
