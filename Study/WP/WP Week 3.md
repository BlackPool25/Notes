**Summary: Structure of Comparison Paragraphs**
**Key Takeaways:**
- A comparison paragraph compares two objects, ideas, places, people, or anything else.
- It can also include contrasting features of these entities.
- In scientific writing, evidence is brought to support the argument.
**Structures for Comparison Paragraphs:**
1. **Block Organization**
    - Begins with a topic sentence comparing/contrasting two ideas.
    - Presents all points of comparison/contrast in separate blocks (idea A and idea B).
    - Concludes by reemphasizing the comparison or contrast.
2. **Point-by-Point Organization**
    - Starts with a similar topic sentence emphasizing compare and contrast.
    - Presents each point of comparison or contrast as separate sentences, using words like "similar to" or "different from".
    - Draws a conclusion by reemphasizing the topic sentence.
**Common Words Used in Comparison Paragraphs:**
- For comparison:
    - Both
    - And
    - Also
    - Too
    - Neither and nor
    - Similar to, the same as, as good/bad/agile as...
- For contrast:
    - More or less than
    - Something better/quicker/smaller than
    - But, while, though (to show a contrast)
    - Not the same as, not as good/bad as...
    - Different from
**Signposts Used in Comparison Paragraphs:**
- Words like "both", "and", and "also" to show similarity.
- Phrases like "however" or "on the other hand" to indicate a contrast.
By following these structures and using the right language, you can effectively organize your comparison paragraphs and convey your ideas clearly.
  
**Meeting Summary**
**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this meeting was to explore language use in comparison paragraphs.  
**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Transition Words:** Signposts used for similarity include "like," "likewise," "also," and similar phrases, while contrast is indicated by words such as "in contrast" or "contrasted with."
2. **Comparison Structures:** Aims to report a comparison between entities, comparative degree use (e.g., faster than), and adverbs that indicate comparison.
3. **Comparative Forms in Academic Writing:**
    - Negative comparisons: not as reliable as
    - Pre-modifying comparisons: information available on Wikipedia is far more misleading
    - Post modifying comparisons: they played better than before
**Action Items:**
1. Use transition words to highlight similarities and contrasts.
2. Apply comparison structures (aims, comparative degree use) in academic writing.
3. Utilize negative, pre-modifying, and post modifying comparisons as needed.
This summary aims to capture the main points discussed during the meeting on language use in comparison paragraphs.
  
**Meeting Summary**
**Purpose:**  
The purpose of this meeting was to explore the concept of block organization in comparison paragraphs.  
**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Block Organization:** A writing approach where two entities are compared and contrasted by presenting all points related to one entity first, followed by a presentation of all points related to the second entity.
2. **Advantages and Disadvantages:** Block organization is not as popular as point-to-point organization but works well for shorter paragraphs; requires readers to wait until the entire argument for the second idea is presented before comparing it with the first.
3. **Sample Analysis:** A sample paragraph comparing Android operating system and iOS used block organization, presenting all details related to Android followed by those related to iOS.
4. **Key Points of Comparison:**
    - Creator/Owner
    - Mechanism behind the operating system (based on Linux kernel)
    - Usage (smartphones, tablets vs. devices like iPhone, iPod)
    - 5G network capabilities
    - Cost (added detail not discussed in previous block)
**Conclusion:**  
Block organization is a useful approach for structuring comparison paragraphs, but it requires careful consideration of the reader's experience and may not be preferred over point-to-point comparisons.  
  
**Meeting Summary: Point-to-Point Organization in Comparison Paragraphs**
**Objective:** Review key takeaways and action items from the meeting on point-to-point organization in comparison paragraphs.
**Key Takeaways:**
- **Definition of Point-to-Point Organization**: A writing style where each sentence compares or contrasts two ideas, with a focus on highlighting similarities and differences.
- **Structure of a Point-to-Point Comparison Paragraph**:
    - Introduction: Topic sentence that declares the points of comparison or contrast between two ideas.
    - Body: Sentences that explain the difference or similarity between the ideas, often using multiple points of comparison in each sentence.
    - Conclusion: Restating the main idea and highlighting the comparison.
**Example Analysis:**
