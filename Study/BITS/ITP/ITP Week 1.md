The operating system is a vital component that manages computer resources and provides a platform for other software to run. It acts as a resource manager, allocating resources based on user privileges and ensuring smooth system operation. Understanding the role of the OS and its types can help users make informed decisions when choosing an operating system for their devices.

**Summary: How Programs Get Executed**

**Understanding Program Execution**

* A program is written in a high-level language (e.g., C) and stored on the disk.
* The program needs to be converted into machine-readable format through compilation.
* After compilation, the operating system loads the program onto Random Access Memory (RAM), which serves as temporary storage.

**Types of Memory**

* **Volatile Memory**: RAM, where data is lost when power supply goes off. Examples: RAM sticks, hard disk cache.
* **Non-Volatile Memory**: Permanent memory that retains data even after power supply goes off. Examples: Hard disks, flash drives.

**Program Execution Process**

1. **Compilation**: The program written in a high-level language is converted into machine-readable format (0s and 1s) by the compiler.
2. **Loading onto RAM**: The compiled program is loaded onto Random Access Memory (RAM), where it awaits execution by the processor.
3. **Execution on CPU**: The operating system calls the program to be executed, and the processor processes each instruction line-by-line.

**Program Execution and Processes**

* A running program is called a sub-process or process.
* Multiple programs can run simultaneously as separate processes in memory.
* Programs under execution are visible in the Task Manager as processes.

**Summary: Algorithms and Flowcharts**

**What are Algorithms?**

* A collection of finite and unambiguous steps to be followed to arrive at the solution of a computation problem
* Used by programmers as a pre-programming tool to write programs

**Difference between Algorithm and Flowchart**

* An algorithm is represented in text format with numbered steps, standard operators, and keywords (e.g., "begin", "end")
* A flowchart is a pictorial representation using different symbols for various types of steps (e.g., start, input/output, computation, decision-making)

**Key Constructs of Algorithms and Flowcharts**

* Sequencing: executing a sequence of statements in a sequential order
* Decision-making: choosing from many alternatives and then selecting which set of statements to execute
* Repetition: executing one or group of statements in a loop in an iterative manner

**Symbols Used in Flowcharts**

* Start (oval-shaped)
* Input/output (parallelogram): for getting inputs or outputs
* Computation (rectangle): for storing results and outputting values
* Decision-making (diamond): with one flow line at the top, one at the bottom, and one at the right side
* Connectors: to connect different portions of flowcharts

**Example Algorithm**

* Begin
	+ Take input a and b
	+ Compute a + b into sum
	+ Output sum
	+ End

**Example Flowchart**

* Start → Input/Output (a, b) → Computation (rectangle) → Decision-making (diamond) → Connector → Stop

**Summary: Incorporating Decision-Making into Flowcharts**

**Incorporating Decision-Making into Algorithms**

* Using if statements and else clauses to break from sequential execution
* If the condition is true, execute one set of statements; otherwise, execute another set

**Translating Decision-Making into a Flowchart**

1. **Start**: Begin with a start symbol in the flowchart.
2. **Input**: Use a parallelogram to represent taking input (in this case, n).
3. **Decision-Making**: Use a diamond symbol to check if the condition is true (e.g., "Is n greater than 0?").
	* If the answer is yes: execute one set of statements.
	* If the answer is no: execute another set of statements.

**Example Flowchart**

1. Start → Input/Output (n) → Diamond (Is n > 0?)
2. If Yes:
	+ Output "n is positive"
3. Else:
	+ Output "Error"

4. **Stop**: Once either the first or second output path is executed, stop.

**Key Takeaway**

* Decision-making in flowcharts involves using a diamond symbol to represent a two-way branching decision.
* The outcome of the decision determines which set of statements to execute next.

**Summary: Incorporating Iterative Construct into Flowcharts**

**Understanding Iterative Construct**

* An iterative construct involves a statement or group of statements inside a loop that are repeated until a certain condition is met.
* Essential for solving repetitive problems, such as computing the sum of n natural numbers.

**Converting Algorithm to Flowchart**

1. **Start**: Begin with a start symbol in the flowchart.
2. **Input**: Use a parallelogram to represent inputting the value of n (e.g., "Input n").
3. **Initialize Variables**: Represent initializing index variable i to 1 and sum to 0 using rectangles.
4. **Decision-Making**: Use a diamond symbol to check if the condition is true: "Is i less than or equal to n?"
	* If yes, execute statements inside loop (add i to sum, increment i).
5. **Loop Continuation**: Connect arrows from end of loop back to decision-making step.
6. **Termination Condition**: When condition becomes false ("i > n"), output the value of sum.
7. **Stop**: Finalize flowchart with a stop symbol.

**Key Takeaways**

* Iterative construct involves using loops and repetition in a flowchart.
* Decision-making symbols (diamonds) are used to create loop conditions.
* Arrows connect loop iterations back to decision-making steps, ensuring logical flow.
* Flowcharts can pictorially represent complex algorithms involving iteration.
