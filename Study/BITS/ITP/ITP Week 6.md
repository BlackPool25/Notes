**Summary of Multi-Dimensional Arrays in C**

A multi-dimensional array in C is essentially a matrix where each element has multiple sub-elements.

### Declaration of 2D Arrays

* Syntax: `type name[rows][columns];`
	+ `type`: the type of elements (e.g., int, float, char)
	+ `name`: the name of the array
	+ `[rows]` and `[columns]`: specify the number of rows and columns in the matrix
* Examples:
	1. `int number[3][4];`
	2. `float f_array[3][2];`
	3. `char name[10][20];`

### Initialization of 2D Arrays

There are three ways to initialize a 2D array:

1. **Direct initialization**: Provide all elements in the matrix, separated by commas and enclosed in curly brackets.
	* Example: `int a[2][3] = { {0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5} };`
2. **Row-wise initialization**: Initialize each row separately using the syntax `row1`, `row2`, etc.
	* Example: `int b[2][3] = {{0, 1, 2}, {3, 4, 5}};` (same as above)
3. **Column-wise initialization**:
	+ If only one row is specified and its size matches the number of inner braces pairs (`{}`), C compiler will assume that many rows are present with column_size elements each.
	+ If both `[rows]` and `[columns]` are empty, it's not allowed.

### Accessing Elements in a 2D Array

* Use the syntax `a[i][j]`, where:
	1. `i`: specifies the row number (starts from 0)
	2. `j`: specifies the column number (starts from 0)

Example code to print each element of a 2D array:

```c
int a[3][4];
// initialize a

for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
        printf("%d ", a[i][j]);
    }
}
```

### Runtime Initialization of a 2D Array

Use `scanf()` statements inside the loop to take input from users and store it in your array.

**Summary: Memory Maps of 2D Arrays in C**

### Introduction

In this video, we explore how 2D arrays are stored in memory in a C program.

### Row Major vs Column Major Format

There are two patterns for storing 2D arrays:

1. **Row Major**: In this format, elements belonging to the same row are stored contiguously.
	* Example: For a 3x3 array `a[3][3]`, addresses in memory would be:
		+ `a`: address of element at row 0, column 0
		+ `a + 1`: address of element at row 0, column 1
		+ `a + 2`: address of element at row 0, column 2
		+ `a + 3`: address of element at row 1, column 0 (not the next in sequence)
	* Note: In C, Row Major is the default format.
2. **Column Major**: In this format, elements belonging to the same column are stored contiguously.
	* Example: For a 3x3 array `a[3][3]`, addresses in memory would be:
		+ `a`: address of element at row 0, column 0
		+ `a + 1`: address of element at row 1, column 0 (not the next in sequence)
		+ `a + 2`: address of element at row 2, column 0

### Key Points

* The name of a C array (`a`) always contains the address of its first element.
* In Row Major format, elements are stored as a linear sequence with each row's elements together.
* In Column Major format, elements are stored as a linear sequence with each column's elements together.

**Important**: This video highlights the memory map difference between Row Major and Column Major formats for 2D arrays in C. Understanding this concept is essential when working with multidimensional arrays in programming languages like C or other related systems where similar data structures may be used.

**Summary: Matrix Addition in C**

### Introduction

This video explains matrix addition in C programming.

### Key Points

* **Matrix Representation**: Matrices in C are represented as 2D arrays.
* **Matrix Addition**: When adding two matrices, corresponding elements from both matrices are added together and stored at the same position in the resulting matrix.
* **Precondition for Matrix Addition**: The number of rows and columns must be equal between two matrices to perform addition.

### Algorithmic Steps

1. Read two matrices (A and B) from the user.
2. Initialize a new matrix C to 0, which will store the sum of A and B.
3. Use nested loops:
	* Outer loop iterates over the number of rows in both matrices (m).
	* Inner loop iterates over the number of columns in both matrices (n).
4. For each element at position i,j in matrix C, add the corresponding elements from matrices A and B (a[i][j] + b[i][j]) and store the result back into matrix C.

### Example Output

The resulting matrix C will display the sum of matrices A and B.

**Note**: Matrix subtraction follows a similar algorithmic step but with subtraction instead of addition. The precondition for both operations remains the same: equal number of rows and columns between two matrices.

**Summary: Matrix Addition Implementation**

### Introduction

This video demonstrates how to implement matrix addition in C programming.

### Key Points

* **Matrix Representation**: Matrices are represented as 2D arrays.
* **Precondition for Matrix Addition**: The number of rows and columns must be equal between two matrices (M1 and M2) to perform addition.
* **Variable Declaration**:
	+ `row` and `col`: constants defining the maximum size of a matrix (10x10).
	+ `i`, `j`: loop counters for iterating over rows and columns.
	+ `row1`, `col1`, `row2`, `col2`: variables to store the actual number of rows and columns for matrices M1 and M2.

### Code Implementation

#### Reading Matrix Sizes from User
```c
scanf("%d %d", &row1, &col1);
scanf("%d %d", &row2, &col2);

if (row1 != row2 || col1 != col2) {
    printf("Addition not possible\n");
    return;
}
```

#### Reading Matrix Elements from User
```c
for (int i = 0; i < row1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col1; j++) {
        scanf("%d", &M1[i][j]);
    }
}

for (int i = 0; i < row2; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col2; j++) {
        scanf("%d", &M2[i][j]);
    }
}
```

#### Performing Matrix Addition
```c
for (int i = 0; i < row1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col1; j++) {
        M3[i][j] = M1[i][j] + M2[i][j];
    }
}
```

#### Printing Matrix Elements
```c
for (int i = 0; i < row1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < col1; j++) {
        printf("%d ", M3[i][j]);
    }
    printf("\n");
}
```
Note: The logic for matrix subtraction is similar, replacing addition with subtraction.

**Matrix Multiplication Summary**

**Pre-conditions for Matrix Multiplication:**

* The number of columns in the first matrix (M1) must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix (M2).
* The resultant matrix (M3) will have dimensions m × r, where m is the number of rows in M1 and r is the number of columns in M2.

**Algorithmic Steps:**

1. Take two matrices, M1 and M2 as input from a user.
	* M1 has number of rows = m and number of columns = n.
	* M2 has number of rows = n and number of columns = r.
2. Initialize an empty matrix M3 with dimensions m × r (number of rows in M1, number of columns in M2).
3. Perform a nesting of three loops to compute the values of the elements of the matrix M3:
	* First loop: i from 0 to m-1 (for each row of M3)
	* Inner loop: j from 0 to r-1 (for each column of M3)
	* Third nested loop: k from 0 to n-1
4. Within the third nested loop:
	* Compute the dot product of ith row elements in M1 and jth column elements in M2 using a variable k.
	* Update M3[i][j] = previous value + (M1[i][k] × M2[k][j]).
5. Display the matrix M3, which contains the product of matrices M1 and M2.

**Example:**

To compute the 0, 0 element in matrix M3:

* Take the dot product of zeroth row elements in M1 (1, 2, 3) with zeroth column elements in M2 (10, 20, 30).
* Compute: (M1[0][k] × M2[k][0]) for k from 0 to n-1.
	+ When k is equal to 0: add the product of 1 and 10.
	+ When k is equal to 1: add the product of 2 and 20.
	+ When k is equal to 2: add the product of 3 and 30.

This process computes each element in matrix M3.

**Matrix Multiplication Program Summary**

**Constants and Matrix Declaration:**

* Define constants for the number of rows (row1, row2, row3) and columns (column1, column2, column3) of matrices M1, M2, and M3.
* Declare matrices M1, M2, and M3 with corresponding dimensions.

**Matrix Input:**

* Read input values for matrix M1:
	+ Outer loop iterates `row1` times
	+ Inner loop iterates `column1` times
	+ Inside inner loop, read value from user and store in `M1[i][j]`
* Repeat same process to read values for matrix M2 with outer loop iterating `row2` times and inner loop iterating `column2` times.

**Matrix Multiplication Check:**

* Check if number of columns in M1 is equal to the number of rows in M2.
* If not, terminate program by printing an error message.

**Matrix Multiplication Computation:**

* Compute dot product for each element in matrix M3:
	+ Outer loop iterates `row3` times (number of rows in M3)
	+ Inner loop iterates `column3` times (number of columns in M3)
	+ Initialize `M3[i][j] = 0`
	+ Compute dot product using logic: `for k from 0 to column1`, compute `(M1[i][k] × M2[k][j])` and add to `M3[i][j]`

**Matrix Output:**

* Print resulting matrix M3:
	+ Outer loop iterates `row3` times
	+ Inner loop iterates `column3` times
	+ Inside inner loop, print value of `M3[i][j]`.

**N-Dimensional Arrays in C Summary**

**Declaring N-Dimensional Arrays:**

* In C, n-dimensional arrays can be declared with values for each dimension.
* For example:
	+ A three-dimensional array is declared with values for dimensions 1, 2, and 3.
	+ A four-dimensional array is declared with values for dimensions 1-4.
	+ A five-dimensional array (5-D) is declared with values for dimensions 1-5.

**Storage Format:**

* N-dimensional arrays in C are stored in row-major format by default.
* This means that the elements of each dimension are stored contiguously, row-by-row.

**Visualization:**

* It's difficult to visualize higher-dimensional arrays (4-D or more) as they require more than three dimensions.
* A 3-D array can be visualized as a cube-like structure with each layer representing a row in memory.
* Example:
	+ 1-D array: a single line of elements
	+ 2-D array: rows and columns, stored in matrix format
	+ 3-D array: layers or "pages" of data, similar to a book

**Strings in C Summary**

**Defining Strings:**

* A string is a collection of characters that are treated as a single entity.
* In C, strings are represented using character arrays.
* The end of the string is marked with a special character called NUL (`\0`).
* There is no separate datatype for representing strings in C; it's just an array of characters.

**Initializing Strings:**

* Strings can be initialized after definition by assigning a value to them, enclosed within double quotes (`"..."`).
* The string will automatically include the NUL character at the end.
* Example: `char str[9] = "I like C";`

**Printing Strings:**

* Strings can be printed using the `printf` statement with the format specifier `%s`.
* This will print each character in the string until it encounters the NUL character.

**Key Takeaways:**

* A valid string must include a NUL character at its end.
* If there is no space to store the NUL character, it can't be treated as a string.
* The `%s` format specifier in `printf` statements should only be used with strings that have been properly initialized.

**Example Code:**

```c
char str[9] = "I like C";
printf("%s\n", str);  // Output: I like C programming
```

Note the difference between this example and one where a string is not explicitly allocated space for its NUL character:

```c
char str[] = "I like C";  // No space allocated for NUL character
printf("%s\n", str);      // Output: Error or garbage value, because no NUL character exists.
```

**Reading Strings in C: A Summary**

**Using `scanf` to Read Strings**

* To read a string using `scanf`, use the format specifier `%s`.
* The variable name should be used without an ampersand (`&`) before it.
* By default, `scanf` reads until it encounters a space character.
* If you want to read only up to a certain character (e.g., between 'a' and 'z'), specify that in the format specifier.

**Example Code:**

```c
char text[30];
printf("Enter a string: ");
scanf("%s", text);
printf("You entered: %s\n", text);
```

* If you enter "hello world", only "hello" will be stored and printed.
* To read up to a space character, use `%29s` (specifying 29 characters) or simply omit the length specifier.

**Using `scanf` with Specific Termination Characters**

* To specify a termination character other than space, use it within square brackets (`[]`) in the format specifier. For example:
```c
char text[200];
printf("Enter a string terminated by ~: ");
scanf("%199s", text);
printf("You entered: %s\n", text);
```
* In this case, `scanf` will stop reading when it encounters a '~' character.

**Using the `gets` Function**

* The `gets` function is simpler to use than `scanf`: just pass in the variable name and it will read up to an Enter (`\n`) or EOF.
```c
char str[200];
printf("Enter a string: ");
gets(str);
printf("You entered: %s\n", str);
```
* Note that `gets` does not perform any error checking, so be careful when using it. It's generally safer to use `fgets` instead.

**Reading Multiline Input**

* To read multiline input, you can use the approach shown in the examples with specific termination characters.
* Alternatively, consider using a loop to read lines until an EOF is encountered.

**String Manipulation: Removing Spaces**

Here's a summary of the code snippet:

**Task:** Remove all spaces from a given string `s` and store the result in another character array `ws`.

**Implementation:**

1. Declare two character arrays `s` (size 80) and `ws` (size 80).
2. Take user input to be stored in `s`.
3. Initialize two integer variables `i` and `j` as loop counters.
4. Run a loop that iterates through each character of `s`, stopping when a null character is encountered.
5. Inside the loop:
	* Check if the current character is not a space (`' '`).
	* If not, assign the current character to `ws[j++]`.
6. After the loop terminates, add a null character to make it a string.
7. Print the resulting string using `puts(ws)`.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Use two loops (one for scanning and one for copying) to remove spaces from an array.
* Increment both `i` and `j` counters in each iteration of the loop.
* Add a null character at the end to make it a valid string.
* Print the resulting string using `puts()`.

**Note:** This code snippet assumes that the user will input a string with no more than 80 characters, including spaces. If longer strings are expected, adjust the array size accordingly.

**Summary of Meeting Notes**

**Key Takeaways:**

* **ctype.h Library Functions:** The library supports various character manipulation functions:
	+ `isdigit`: Returns 1 if the input character is a digit
	+ `islower`, `isalpha`, and `isspace` return 1 for lowercase alphabets, letters, and spaces respectively
	+ `isupper` returns 1 for capital letters
	+ `toupper` converts to uppercase and returns it; `tolower` does the opposite

* **string.h Library Functions:** The library supports various string manipulation functions:
	+ `strcpy`: Copies contents of one string into another
	+ `strcat`: Concatenates two strings, placing the second after the first
	+ `strlen`: Returns length of a given input string
	+ `strcmp`: Compares two strings lexicographically and returns 0 if they're equal; greater than 0 if S1 > S2, less than 0 otherwise

**Meeting Notes Transcript Highlights:**

* The library functions allow for efficient character and string manipulation in C programs.
* Examples illustrate how these functions work:
	+ Comparing two strings using `strcmp`: It compares characters from left to right until it finds a mismatch or reaches the end of one of the strings.
	+ Using `strcpy` and `strcat` with examples: These functions allow for efficient copying and concatenation of strings.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Lexicographical Comparison**: A way to compare two strings by comparing their characters from left to right, until a mismatch or end is reached.

**Summary**

The provided text highlights several key functions from the `string.h` library:

* **atof**: Converts a string to its floating-point equivalent
* **atoi**: Converts a string to an integer, truncating decimal places if present
* **strncat**: Concatenates only a specified number of characters from one string into another
* **strncmp**: Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters and returns:
	+ 0: If the first `n` characters match exactly
	+ Greater than 0: If the first character in S1 is greater than its counterpart in S2 (when comparing lexicographically)
	+ Less than 0: If the first character in S1 is less than its counterpart in S2
* **strncpy**: Copies a specified number of characters from one string into another

Additionally, it mentions:

* **strstr**: Checks if a substring exists within a larger string and returns:
	+ A pointer to the start of the matched substring (if found)
	+ NULL: If no match is found

**Summary**

The provided text discusses two examples of string manipulation:

1. **Calculating String Length**: A program reads a string from the user and calculates its length using a while loop to read individual characters into an array until a newline character is encountered.

2. **Implementing strcat Function**: The `strcat` function concatenates two strings, s1 and s2, by:
	* Traversing s1 until a null character is found (i.e., the end of the string)
	* Starting at that position in s1 and inserting characters from s2
	* Traversing s2 until a null character is encountered
	* Assigning a null character to the concatenated string

The program uses two while loops: one to traverse s1 and find its end, and another to insert characters from s2 into s1. The implementation includes incrementing loop variables `i` and `j`, checking for null characters, and assigning the final result back to `s1`.

Key takeaways:

* Using a while loop with an incremented pointer variable (`i`) to traverse a string until a null character is found.
* Implementing the strcat function by traversing s2 and inserting its characters into s1 starting from the position of the last null character in s1.
* Assigning a null character to the concatenated string `s1` after concatenation.

**Summary**

This video discusses how to determine if a given string is a palindrome using C programming.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Palindrome Definition**: A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, such as "Abba" or "Malayalam".
2. **Checking for Palindrome**: The program checks for palindromes by comparing characters from both ends of the string.
3. **Implementation**:
	* Initialize variables `left` to 0 (first character) and `right` to the length of the string (last character).
	* Iterate until `left` is less than or equal to `right`.
	* Compare characters at indices `left` and `right`. If they are not equal, set a flag to 0.
	* After iteration completes, check if the flag is still 1. If so, print that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, print that it's not.

**Key Code Snippets:**

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAX_SIZE 80

int main() {
    char str[MAX_SIZE];
    int len;
    
    // Read input from user and store in array 'str'
    
    int left = 0;
    int right = len - 1; // initialize right to the last character
    
    while (left <= right) { // loop until left > right
        if (str[left] != str[right]) {
            flag = 0; // set flag to indicate mismatch
            break;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }

    if (flag == 1) {
        printf("The string is a palindrome.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The string is not a palindrome.\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Summary**

This video explains how to declare and initialize a 2D array of type character (char) to store multiple strings with a specified maximum length for each string.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Declaring an Array of Strings**: Use the syntax `char name[rows][columns] = { {"string1", "string2"}, ... }` where:
	* `name`: array name
	* `rows`: number of strings to store (number of rows)
	* `columns`: maximum length for each string (number of columns)
2. **Initializing the Array**: Use double braces `{ {"string1", "string2"} }` with each string in double quotes.
3. **Accessing a Specific String**: Use the syntax `printf("%s\n", city[0]);` where:
	* `city`: array name
	* `[0]`: index of the desired string (starts from 0)
4. **Automatic Null Termination**: When initializing a 2D array with strings, each string is automatically null-terminated.

**Example Code:**

```c
char cities[4][12] = {
    {"Chennai", "Kolkata"},
    {"Mumbai", "New Delhi"}
};
```

To print the second city:

```c
printf("%s\n", cities[0]); // prints Chennai
printf("%s\n", cities[1]); // prints Kolkata
```
