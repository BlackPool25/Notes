**Summary**

This video introduces the basics of logic, focusing on propositions, truth tables, and connectors.

**Key Concepts:**

* A proposition is a declarative sentence that declares a fact and is either true (T) or false (F).
* Propositions are used to build compound propositions using logical operators.
* Logical operators include:
	+ Negation (-): the negation of p
	+ Conjunction (∧): the conjunction of two propositions
	+ Disjunction (∨): the disjunction of two propositions

**Truth Tables:**

* A truth table is a table that lists all possible values of propositional variables in a compound proposition and their corresponding truth values.
* The negation operator (-) has one propositional variable, p.

**Examples:**

* Propositions are declarative sentences that declare facts.
* Non-examples of propositions include requests, questions, and algebraic expressions with variables (e.g., x + 3 = 5).

**Connectors:**

* Conjunction (∧): true when both propositions are true; false otherwise.
	+ Truth table for conjunction:
		- Both p and q false: F
		- P false, q true: F
		- P true, q false: F
		- Both p and q true: T
* Disjunction (∨): false when both propositions are false; true otherwise.
	+ Truth table for disjunction:
		- Both p and q false: F
		- P false, q true: T
		- P true, q false: T
		- Both p and q true: T

**Summary of Implication (Conditional) Proposition**

**Key Takeaways:**

1. The implication or conditional statement "p implies q" is false only when p is true and q is false.
2. If p is false, then p implies q is automatically true.
3. If q is true, then p implies q is automatically true.

**Definition of Implication (Conditional):**

The proposition "if p then q" or "p implies q" can be thought of as a promise made by someone (e.g., an instructor) to do something if a certain condition (the hypothesis, p) is met. The promise is only conditioned on the premise being true.

**Truth Table:**

| p | q | ¬p | ¬q |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | F | F |
| T | F | F | T |
| F | T | T | F |
| F | F | T | T |

The truth table shows the possible combinations of truth values for p, q, and their negations. The implication "p implies q" is true when both p and ¬q are false (i.e., when p is true and q is also true), or when either p or ¬q is false.

**Other Connectives:**

* Converse: If q then p
* Contrapositive: If ¬q then ¬p
* Inverse: If ¬p then ¬q

These connectives can be used to build more complex propositions and analyze their truth values.

**Summary of Logical Equivalence**

The concept of logical equivalence states that two compound propositions are logically equivalent if their truth tables are the same.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Tautology:** A compound proposition is a tautology if it evaluates to true for every combination of truth values of its proposition variables.
2. **Contradiction:** A compound proposition is a contradiction if it evaluates to false for every combination of truth values of its proposition variables.
3. **Logical Equivalence (p ≡ q):** Two compound propositions p and q are logically equivalent if their truth tables have the same columns, meaning they evaluate to true or false in exactly the same way under all possible assignments of truth values to their proposition variables.

**Example:**

Consider two propositions:

*   P implies Q
*   ¬Q implies ¬P

Their truth tables show that these two implications are equivalent, as both always evaluate to true when p and q have opposite truth values.

Here's a summary of the concepts discussed in the provided text:

*   **Propositional Functions and Predicates:** A propositional function or predicate is a statement of the form P(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n), where P is an n-place predicate (also known as an n-ary predicate) and x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are variables. The value of the propositional function at a particular point in space can be expressed by substituting values for these variables.
*   **Domain or Universe of Discourse:** A domain refers to the set from which the n-tuples in a predicate take their values.
*   **Universal Quantifier (for all):** Universal quantification states that P(x) is true for every value x takes on within its specified domain. The notation "for all" denotes this universal quantification, and an element of the domain that causes P(x) to be false is called a counterexample.

Here are some key concepts regarding logical equivalences involving predicates and quantifiers:

*   **Universal Quantifier Equivalence:** If two universally quantified statements have the same truth value for every possible predicate substitution in their respective domains, then they are logically equivalent.
*   **Logical Equivalence of Statements with Predicates and Quantifiers:** Two statements involving predicates and quantifiers are logically equivalent if they always share the same truth values regardless of which specific predicate values are used or any particular domain is applied.

**Summary of Negating Quantified Expressions**

This summary provides an overview of negating quantified expressions, including statements involving single quantifiers and nested quantifiers.

### Statement Involving Single Quantifier

* The statement "for all x P(x)" can be expressed as ∀x∃y(P(x)∧P(y))
* To negate this expression, we flip the order of the quantifiers to obtain ∃x∀y¬(P(x)∧P(y))

### Statement Involving Existential Quantifier

* The statement "there exists x P(x)" can be expressed as ∃x(P(x)∧Q(x))
* To negate this expression, we flip the order of the quantifiers to obtain ∀x¬(P(x)∧Q(x)) or ∀y∀z ¬(P(y) ∧ Q(z))

### Nested Quantifiers

* When both quantifiers are universal (e.g. "for all x for all y P(x,y)") or both existential (e.g. "there exists x there exists y Q(x,y)"), the order of the quantifiers does not matter.
* However, when the quantifiers are different (e.g. "for every integer x that is an integer y so that x + y = 0" vs "there exists x for all y P(x,y)"), the order of the quantifiers matters.

### Rules for Negating Nested Quantifiers

1. When negating a statement involving nested quantifiers, successively apply the rules for negating statements involving single quantifiers.
2. Flip the order of the quantifiers when negating a statement with an existential or universal quantifier that is not part of a conjunction (e.g., ¬(P(x) ∧ Q(x)) becomes ∃x ∀y ¬P(x) ∨ ∀z ¬Q(z)).
3. When both quantifiers are different, consider the implications of switching their order.

**Key Takeaways**

* Negating a statement involving single quantifier flips the order of the quantifier.
* Negating a statement involving nested quantifiers involves successively applying rules for negating statements with single quantifiers and careful consideration of the implications of changing the order of different quantifiers.

Here is a concise summary of the video:

**Introduction**

The speaker introduces an example of building an argument using basic logical rules: "If it rains today, we will have a pleasant evening." The two premises are stated as p (it rained today) and q (we will have a pleasant evening). Using modus ponens, the conclusion can be inferred.

**Rules of Inference**

The speaker explains five rules of inference:

1. **Modus Ponens**: If p implies q and p is true, then we can conclude that therefore, q is true.
2. **Modus Tollens**: If p implies q and not-q is true, then we can conclude that therefore, not-p is true.
3. **Hypothetical Syllogism**: If p implies q and q implies r, then we can infer that p implies r.
4. **Disjunctive Syllogism**: If p or q are true and not-p is true, then we can conclude that therefore, q is true.
5. **Universal Instantiation**, **Universal Generalization**, **Existential Instantiation**, and **Existential Generalization**

* Universal Instantiation: If for all x P(x) is true, then P(c) is true for an arbitrary c in the domain.
* Universal Generalization: If P(c) is true for some element c, then we can conclude that therefore, for all x, P(x) is true.
* Existential Instantiation: If there exists x such that P(x) is true, then we can conclude that therefore, P(c) is true for some element c in the domain.
* Existential Generalization: We can infer that there exists an x such that P(x) is true if we have found elements c for which P(c) is true.

**Conclusion**

The speaker concludes by emphasizing that these rules of inference provide a foundation for mathematical proofs and encourages viewers to review additional material with examples.

Based on the provided text, here is a concise summary of the meeting notes:

**Introduction**

A mathematical statement can be shown to be true through a valid argument called a "proof".

**Terminology**

* **Theorem**: A mathematical statement that can be proven true.
* **Proposition**: A minor theorem that is relatively straightforward to prove. (Note: this term is different from the formal logic definition of proposition.)
* **Lemmas**: Minor theorems used as intermediaries to prove larger theorems or more complicated statements.
* **Corollary**: A theorem established directly from a previously proved theorem, usually in a single step.
* **Conjecture**: A proposed statement that may be true, based on partial evidence or intuition.

**Notation and Definitions**

When stating theorems, implicit universal quantifiers are used. For example: "For all positive real numbers x and y, if x > y, then x^4 is greater than y^4".

* **Even and Odd Numbers**: An integer n is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k. If not, it's odd.
* **Parity**: Two integers have the same parity (both even or both odd) or opposite parity (one even, one odd).
* **Rational and Irrational Numbers**: A number r is rational if it can be written as p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed in this form.

**Key Takeaways**

* Theorems establish the truth of mathematical statements.
* Propositions, lemmas, corollaries, and conjectures are types of theorems or related concepts.
* Universal quantifiers may be implicit when stating theorems.
* Even and odd numbers have distinct definitions based on existence properties.

**Direct Proof: A Mathematical Technique**

A direct proof is a method used in mathematics to establish the truth of a statement by providing a sequence of logical steps that begin with an assumption and ultimately lead to the conclusion.

**Key Components of Direct Proof**

1. **Statement**: The theorem or proposition to be proven.
2. **Assumption**: The hypothesis of the implication, typically stated as "suppose n is an odd integer."
3. **Sequence of Steps**: A series of logical deductions using definitions, axioms, previously proven theorems, and rules of inference to reach the conclusion.

**Example: Proving "If n is an odd integer, then n^2 is odd"**

1. Start by assuming that p (n is an odd integer).
2. Express p as a definition: n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.
3. Square both sides to get: n^2 = (2k + 1)^2
4. Expand and simplify the expression using algebraic rules:
   * (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
5. Factor out a common term of 2 from the first two terms: n^2 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1
6. Recognize that both k and k+0.5 are integers, so multiplying them by an integer is also valid.
7. Deduce that n^2 can be written as 2 times some integer (l), plus the constant term (+1)
8. Conclude using the definition of odd numbers: since l is an integer, n^2 = 2(l) + 1 implies that n^2 is indeed odd.

**Verifying Direct Proof**

* Confirm that each step logically follows from the previous one.
* Ensure all mathematical rules and definitions are correctly applied throughout.
* Verify that the conclusion matches what we initially set out to prove (i.e., if n is an odd integer, then n^2 is also an odd integer).

**Indirect Proof: A Mathematical Technique**

An indirect proof, also known as a proof by contraposition, is a method used in mathematics to establish the truth of a statement by proving its negation.

**Key Components of Indirect Proof**

1. **Statement**: The theorem or proposition to be proven.
2. **Assumption**: The hypothesis of the implication, typically stated as "suppose n is an even integer."
3. **Sequence of Steps**: A series of logical deductions using definitions, axioms, previously proven theorems, and rules of inference to reach a contradiction.

**Example: Proving "If 3n + 2 is odd, then n is odd"**

1. Start by assuming that q (n is an even integer).
2. Express p as a definition: 3n + 2 = (2k + 1)^2 for some integer k.
   * However, this direct approach does not lead to the conclusion immediately.

Instead, write out the contrapositive:
"If n is not odd, then 3n + 2 is not odd"
**This implies that if n is even, then 3n + 2 is even**

1. Prove the contrapositive statement by starting with an assumption.
	* Suppose n is an even integer (i.e., k = l/2).
	* Use this to show that 3n + 2 can be written as a multiple of 2 (i.e., some number times 2).

**Step-by-Step Proof**

1. Start by assuming n is an even integer, then:
   * Write n = 2k for some integer k.
   * Show that 3n + 2 can be rewritten as: 6k + 2
   * Factorize to show that it's equal to: (3k + 1) × 2
   * Since l is an integer, the statement that n = 2l holds true.

**Conclusion**

By showing that if n is even, then 3n + 2 can be written as a multiple of 2, we have established that:

"If n is not odd (i.e., it's even), then 3n + 2 is not odd (i.e., it's even)"

This shows the contrapositive of our original statement to be true. Since an implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can conclude that the original statement "If n is odd, then 3n + 2 is odd" is also true.

**Verifying Indirect Proof**

* Confirm that each step logically follows from the previous one.
* Ensure all mathematical rules and definitions are correctly applied throughout.
* Verify that the conclusion matches what we initially set out to prove.

**Vacuous Proof**

A vacuous proof is a type of proof used in mathematics where the hypothesis of an implication statement "p implies q" is always false.

**Key Characteristics of Vacuous Proofs**

1. **Hypothesis**: The proposition p that serves as the premise for the conditional statement.
2. **Conclusion**: The proposition q that follows from the truth of p (i.e., q).
3. **Proof**: By demonstrating that the hypothesis p is always false, thereby rendering the implication true.

**Example 1: x^4 < -2**

Suppose we want to prove "If x is a real number such that x^2 + 1 < 0, then x^4 < -2."

* **Hypothesis**: x^2 + 1 ≤ 0
* **Conclusion**: x^4 < -2

Since the hypothesis is always false (x cannot have imaginary roots), we can conclude that:

"Theorem: If x is a real number such that x^2 + 1 ≤ 0, then x^4 < -2. The conclusion holds vacuously."

**Example 2: Trivial Proof**

Suppose we want to prove "If q is always true, then p implies q for any proposition p."

* **Hypothesis**: q (always true)
* **Conclusion**: If q is always true, then p implies q.

Since the hypothesis is always true and the conclusion follows from this truth, we can conclude that:

"Theorem: If q is always true, then p implies q. The theorem holds trivially."

**Verifying Vacuous Proofs**

1. Confirm that each step of the proof logically follows.
2. Ensure all mathematical rules and definitions are correctly applied throughout.

Note: Trivial proofs follow a similar structure to vacuous proofs but have an additional condition where the conclusion is also always true, regardless of the truth value of p.
