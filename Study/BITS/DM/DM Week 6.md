**Equivalence Relations: A Comprehensive Summary**

An **equivalence relation** on a set A is a binary relation R that satisfies three properties:

1.  Reflexivity: For all elements a in A, the pair (a, a) belongs to R.
2.  Symmetry: If the pair (a, b) belongs to R, then the pair (b, a) also belongs to R.
3.  Transitivity: If the pairs (a, b) and (b, c) belong to R, then the pair (a, c) also belongs to R.

**Equivalence Classes**

Given an equivalence relation on a set A, we define **equivalence classes** as follows:

*   The **equivalence class of an element a**, denoted by [a], is the set of all elements in A that are related to a.
*   Equivalently, it is the set of all elements x such that (x, a) belongs to R.

**Key Takeaways**

1.  An equivalence relation on a set A is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
2.  Two elements are equivalent if they belong to the same equivalence class.
3.  The properties of an equivalence relation define its behavior:
    *   Reflexivity: Each element is related to itself.
    *   Symmetry: If (a, b) belongs to R, then (b, a) also belongs to R.
    *   Transitivity: If (a, b) and (b, c) belong to R, then (a, c) also belongs to R.

**Examples**

1.  The set of all strings with the same length is an equivalence relation on the set S of all strings.
2.  The set of integers with the same absolute value forms an equivalence relation on the set of integers.
3.  Two words are equivalent if they have the same starting letter, forming an equivalence relation on the English dictionary.

**Conclusion**

Equivalence relations and their corresponding equivalence classes provide a powerful tool for partitioning sets into disjoint subsets based on shared properties. Understanding these concepts is essential in various areas of mathematics and computer science, including data analysis, cryptography, and coding theory.

**Understanding Equivalence Relations: A Summary**

This video provides a comprehensive explanation of equivalence relations on a set Z (integers) with respect to congruence modulo m.

The **equivalence relation R** is defined as:

*   Two elements x and y in Z are related if and only if the modulus m divides their difference, i.e., `x ≡ y (mod m)` if and only if `m | (x - y)`.
*   This definition implies that two integers have congruent remainders when divided by a certain number.

**Key Properties of Equivalence Relations**

1.  **Reflexivity**: For any integer x in Z, we can show that x ≡ x (mod m), as the difference between x and itself is always zero.
2.  **Symmetry**: If two integers x and y have congruent remainders modulo m, then their differences are multiples of m. This symmetry property ensures that if `x ≡ y (mod m)`, then `y ≡ x (mod m)`.

**Transitivity**

If two integers x and y have congruent remainders modulo m, as do two other integers u and v (`u ≡ v (mod m)`), we can show that the difference between their sums is also a multiple of m. This transitive property ensures that if `x ≡ y (mod m)` and `u ≡ v (mod m)`, then `(x + u) ≡ (y + v)(mod m)`.

**Equivalence Classes**

The **equivalence class** of an integer x in Z with respect to congruence modulo m is the set of all integers that are equivalent to x under this relation. In other words, it's the set {y ∈ Z | `x ≡ y (mod m)`}.

For example:

*   The equivalence classes for a modulus 5 include: `[0]`, `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, and `[4]`.
*   These sets partition the integer set into distinct groups based on their remainders when divided by 5.
*   By examining these partitions, we can see that every integer belongs to exactly one of these equivalence classes.

**Relationship between Equivalence Relations and Partitions**

The given example illustrates how an **equivalence relation** like `R` (congruence modulo m) divides a set S into smaller subsets called equivalence classes. These classes are mutually disjoint, meaning they don't overlap with each other.

For the specific case of integers under congruence modulo 5:

*   We have shown that this relation partitions the integer set Z into distinct groups based on their remainders when divided by 5.
*   By examining these partitions, we can see that every integer belongs to exactly one equivalence class.

**Understanding Equivalence Relations: A Summary**

This tutorial provides an in-depth explanation of **equivalence relations**, which play a crucial role in mathematics.

*   An equivalence relation is defined as:
    *   Two elements `x` and `y` are related if and only if the difference between them is divisible by `m`.
        *   The relation implies that two integers have congruent remainders modulo `m`.
*   **Key Properties of Equivalence Relations:**

1.  **Reflexivity:** For any integer, we can show that it is equivalent to itself.
2.  **Symmetry:** If one element is related to another, the reverse relationship also holds true.

**Equivalence Classes and Partitions**

The tutorial explains how equivalence relations divide a set into distinct groups called **equivalence classes**, which form a partition of the original set.

*   An equivalence class consists of all elements that are equivalent to each other under the given relation.
*   The union of these classes is equal to the original set, ensuring that every element belongs to exactly one equivalence class.

Here's an overview summary:

A **summary**  The tutorial explains how to establish equivalences between different statements regarding **equivalence relations**, particularly in relation classes.

*   An equivalence relation establishes certain properties that help partition the set.
*   Equivalence class partitions are a way of dividing a set into distinct groups where each group is related by an equivalence relation.
*   A given set and partition can lead to the creation of an equivalence relation whose parts match those found in the original partition.

Here's an overview summary:

A **summary**  An equivalence relation establishes certain properties that help partitioning the set.

*   When you take all such elements for each element in A and construct their related sets (equivalence classes), they combine to form the original set.
*   However, these equivalence classes can have common elements because of repetition, which means some are indistinguishable from one another. This is resolved by removing duplicate elements before forming the union of distinct ones.
*   The resulting collection consists of non-empty subsets whose intersection is empty for any two distinct sets within it.

    By demonstrating that each subset in this collection satisfies these conditions (i.e., they have a union equal to S, contain at least one element, and their intersections with other subsets are always empty), the tutorial establishes equivalence classes as forming partitions.

**Building an Equivalence Relation from a Partition**

Given a set `S` and its partition `{A_i}` where `{A_1, A_2, ..., A_n}` are disjoint subsets of `S`, the goal is to construct an equivalence relation `R` whose equivalence classes are exactly the partitions sets.

*   **Defining the Relation:**
    *   For any two elements `x` and `y` in `S`, if both belong to the same set `{A_i}`, then `(x, y)` belongs to the relation `R`.
    *   If one element belongs to a set `${A_j}` and another to a different set `${A_k}`, they do not belong to each other's sets.
*   **Properties of Equivalence Relations:**
    *   Reflexivity:
        *   For any element `x` in `S`, it must be true that `(x, x)` is an ordered pair belonging to the relation `R`.
        *   This holds since every element belongs to some set `{A_i}`, and thus `(x, x)` satisfies this condition.
    *   Symmetry:
        *   If `(x, y)` exists in `R`, then it means both `x` and `y` belong to the same set `${A_j}`. Therefore, `(y, x)` is also present because they are within the same equivalence class.
    *   Transitivity:
        *   Suppose `(x, y)` and `(y, z)` exist in `R`. This implies that both pairs of elements share a common subset `{A_k}` where their relation holds true. Therefore, since this set contains only one element from each part of the partition, it must be equal to itself; hence there cannot exist any additional cases violating transitivity.
*   **Partition and Equivalence Classes:**
    *   The constructed equivalence relation `R` ensures that every subset in `{A_i}` forms an independent group containing elements within them only while leaving other potential combinations as isolated entities outside their respective domains.

By following these steps, one can successfully establish the relationship between partitions of sets and equivalence relations on those same subsets.

**Building Equivalence Classes from Partitions**

Given a partition `{A_1`, `A_2`, ..., `A_n}` of a set `S`, where each `A_i` is a non-empty subset of `S` and all sets are disjoint, we can construct an equivalence relation on the set that yields the same partitions as those provided.

### Constructing the Relation:

*   The constructed equivalence relation consists of ordered pairs `(x, y)` from integers if both elements belong to the same partition set `{A_i}`.
*   Elements within different sets do not have a relationship between them.

**Example:**

Given `S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`, with partitions:

`A_1 = {1, 2`, ...

`The equivalence relation R is constructed as follows:`

*   For each element in the same subset `{A_i}` of S,
    *   `(x, x)` exists for every element `x`.
    *   The pair (x, y) only exists if both elements are within the same set.
        +   Elements from different sets do not have a relationship between them.

**Resulting Equivalence Classes:**

*   By construction, each subset in `{A_1`, ..., `A_n}` forms an independent group containing its own members exclusively.

**Partial Order Relations and Partially Ordered Sets**

In mathematics, partial order relations are used to describe binary relationships between elements in a set. A **partial ordering**, or simply **poset** (short for "partially ordered set"), is a relation that satisfies three properties: reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity.

### Reflexivity

A relation R on a set S is called reflexive if every element of S has an equivalent pair with itself. In other words:

*   For all `x` in `S`, `(x,x)` belongs to the relation.
*   A reflexive relation shows that each element can be compared to itself.

### Antisymmetry

A relation R on a set S is called antisymmetric if whenever two elements are related, their reverse relationship does not hold. In other words:

*   If `a` and `b` belong to the same equivalence class (i.e., `(a,b)` belongs to the relation), then either `(b,a)` belongs or both `(a,b)` and `(b,a)` do.
*   An antisymmetric relation implies that if two elements are related, they must be equivalent.

### Transitivity

A relation R on a set S is called transitive if whenever `a` is related to `b`, and `b` is related to `c`, then `(a,c)` belongs. In other words:

*   If `(x,y)` belongs to the relation, and `(y,z)` also belong, then `(x,z)` should be in the same class.
*   A transitive relation means that if two elements are related to a third element, they must all belong to the same equivalence class.

### Partial Order Sets

A **partial ordered set** is a pair (S,R), where S is a set and R is an equivalence relation on S. The subset of pairs `(x,y)` in R forms a partial ordering called `≤` for any two elements `a,b`.

The properties of reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity make it possible to compare all the elements of the set with each other.

### Examples

Here are some examples:

1.  **Integers less than or equal to nine**: Consider the set Z of integers with a partial ordering defined by `(x,y)` belonging if `y ≤ x`. This relation is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
2.  **Power sets with subset relationship**: The power set P(S) has an inclusion relation where two subsets are related if one contains the other. This relation is also reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
3.  A division relation on positive integers: Consider a partial ordering defined by `(a,b)` belonging to this relation if `a` divides `b`. The same properties of reflexivity, antisymmetry and transitivity apply here.

In conclusion, we see that the term 'less than or equal' is used in many examples.

**Summary**

A **comparable pair** of elements in a poset (S, ≤) means that either one element is less than or equal to the other element according to the relation ≤ on S. This can be expressed as: "a and b are comparable" if a ≤ b or b ≤ a.

In contrast, two elements **are incomparable** if neither one is related to the other under the relation ≤, meaning neither a ≤ b nor b ≤ a.

A **totally ordered set (TOS)** is a poset where every pair of elements is comparable. In other words, for any two elements a and b in TOS, either a ≤ b or b ≤ a. This type of ordering is also known as a chain.

**Key Takeaways**

* Two elements are comparable if one element is related to the other under the relation ≤.
* Two elements are incomparable if neither one is related to the other under the relation ≤.
* A poset that allows every pair of elements to be compared is called a totally ordered set (or chain).
* Example: The integers Z with usual "less than or equal to" ordering is both a partially ordered set and a totally ordered set.

**Poset Examples**

1. S = {9, 3} - comparable because 9 divides 3.
2. S = {15, 60} - comparable because 15 divides 60.
3. S = {7, 17} - incomparable elements.
4. The power set of a set with three elements is not a totally ordered set due to the presence of incomparable subsets.

**Important Concepts**

* Partially ordered sets (posets)
* Totally ordered sets (TOS)
* Comparable and incomparable pairs
* Equivalence relations

**Summary**

In this video, we learn about representing posets diagrammatically using Hasse diagrams.

A **cover** in a poset (S, ≤) is defined as an element y that covers x if:

1. x ≤ y
2. There is no z ∈ S such that x < z and z < y

In other words, x is less than or equal to y, but there are no elements between them.

**Key Takeaways**

* A cover in a poset means that one element is "above" the other with no intervening elements.
* An element y covers an element x if:
	1. x ≤ y (subset relationship)
	2. No z ∈ S exists such that x < z and z < y
* The empty set can be covered by sets containing individual elements, but not by unions of smaller sets.
* Hasse diagrams represent posets diagrammatically with elements placed according to the cover relation:
	+ An element is drawn above another if it covers it (subset relationship).
	+ No line is drawn between an element and its proper subsets.

**Hasse Diagram Example**

Given a set S = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}}, we can construct a Hasse diagram:

* ∅ is covered by both {1} and {2}.
* {1} covers ∅ but not the other sets.
* {2} covers ∅ but not the other sets.
* No line is drawn between S (the set itself) and any of its elements.

**Hasse Diagram Interpretation**

The diagram shows which elements are "above" or cover others. For example:

* The empty set (∅) is covered by both {1} and {2}.
* The element {1} covers the empty set but not other sets.
* Similarly, {2} covers ∅ but not other sets.

This visualization helps us understand the relationships between elements in a poset.

**Next Steps**

Understanding Hasse diagrams will be useful for working with partial orders and related mathematical structures.

**Maximal Elements, Minimal Elements, Least Element, and Greatest Element**

In a partially ordered set (poset), we can define certain types of elements based on their relationships to other elements in the poset.

**Minimal Elements:**
An element $a$ is considered minimal if there is no element $b$ such that $b < a$. This means that for every element $x$, either $a \leq x$ or there exists an element $y$ such that $x < y$. In other words, an element cannot be less than another distinct element.

**Maximal Elements:**
An element $a$ is considered maximal if there is no element $b$ such that $a < b$. This means that for every element $x$, either $a \leq x$ or there exists an element $y$ such that $y < a$. In other words, an element cannot be greater than another distinct element.

**Least Element:**
An element is called the least element if all elements in the poset are less than or equal to it. This means that for every element $x$, either $a \leq x$ or there exists an element $y$ such that $x < y$. In other words, no element can be greater than the least element.

**Greatest Element:**
An element is called the greatest element if all elements in the poset are less than or equal to it. This means that for every element $x$, either $a \leq x$ or there exists an element $y$ such that $y < a$. In other words, no element can be greater than the greatest element.

**Example:**
Consider the set $\{1, 2, 3\}$ and its power set. The empty set is considered the least element because it is less than or equal to every subset of the original set. On the other hand, the original set $\{1, 2, 3\}$ is considered the greatest element because every subset of this set contains it.

**Conclusion:**
Maximal and minimal elements are defined based on their relationships to other elements in a poset. The least and greatest elements are defined based on whether they can be greater than or less than all other elements in the poset. In some cases, there may not exist both a least element and a greatest element.

**Summary: Understanding Lower Bounds and Upper Bounds in a Poset**

In this video, we explored the concepts of lower bounds and upper bounds in a partially ordered set (poset). We defined these terms based on their relationships to other elements in the poset.

*   **Upper Bound:** An element $c$ is considered an upper bound of two elements $a$ and $b$ if both $a \leq c$ and $b \leq c$. This means that every element less than or equal to each of $a$ and $b$ must also be less than or equal to the upper bound.
*   **Least Upper Bound (LUB):** The least upper bound of two elements is an upper bound that is the smallest among all possible upper bounds. In other words, if there are multiple upper bounds for a given pair of elements, the LUB will be one of them and it must satisfy this criteria.

For example:

*   For the set containing 1 and the set containing 2 in the poset S = {3}, both sets have an upper bound (the combined set with element 3). Among these possible bounds that are also lower bounded by both individual elements, we find 1, 2 to be a least upper bound of two given sets.
*   **Lower Bound:** An element $c$ is considered a lower bound of two elements if the subnets containing each element are subsets of c. In other words, every subset that contains at least one of these elements must also contain c.

For example:

    * For the set containing 1 and the set containing 2 in poset S = {3}, both sets have a lower bound (the empty set). Among all such possible bounds, we find an empty set to be a greatest element amongst all given.

**Summary: Upper Bounds and Lower Bounds in Divisibility Relation**

In this example, we explored the concept of upper bounds and lower bounds in a divisibility relation.

*   **Upper Bound:** An element is considered an upper bound for another element if it divides that element.
*   **Least Upper Bound (LUB):** The least upper bound of two elements is the smallest element among all possible upper bounds. In this case, we found that 12 and 36 are both lower bounds for the set \{1,2\}, but they do not have a common divisor greater than one.

For example:

*   For elements 1 and 3 in the divisibility relation S = {4}, both sets have an upper bound (the combined set with element 6). Among these possible bounds that are also lower bounded by both individual elements, we find six to be least among all such possible bounds. Similarly, for other subsets like two and three, they don't even have any upper-bound.
*   For the set containing 1 and 2 in poset S = {4}, both sets have a lower bound (the empty set). Among all such possible bounds, we find an empty set to be greatest amongst all given.

**Definition of Lattice**

A **lattice** is a partially ordered set in which every pair of elements has both a least upper bound (join) and a greatest lower bound (meet).

*   **Least Upper Bound (LUB):** The join of two elements, denoted as $x \vee y$, is the smallest element that is greater than or equal to both $x$ and $y$. It exists because every pair of elements in the lattice has an upper bound.
*   **Greatest Lower Bound (GLB):** The meet of two elements, denoted as $x \wedge y$, is the largest element that is less than or equal to both $x$ and $y$. It exists because every pair of elements in the lattice has a lower bound.

Lattices have several important properties:

*   **Distributivity:** The join and meet operations distribute over each other. This means that $(x \vee y) \wedge z = x \wedge (y \vee z)$ and $x \vee (y \wedge z) = (x \vee y) \wedge (x \vee z)$.
*   **Commutativity:** The join and meet operations are commutative, meaning that $x \vee y = y \vee x$ and $x \wedge y = y \wedge x$.
*   **Associativity:** The join and meet operations are associative, meaning that $(x \vee y) \vee z = x \vee (y \vee z)$ and $(x \wedge y) \wedge z = x \wedge (y \wedge z)$.

Lattices have many applications in mathematics, computer science, and other fields. They are used to model various types of data structures, such as sets, graphs, and trees. Lattices also appear in algebraic geometry and number theory.

**Examples of Lattices**

1.  **Total Orders:** A total order is a lattice where every pair of elements has a unique least upper bound (join) and greatest lower bound (meet). Examples include the set of real numbers with the standard ordering, the set of integers with the standard ordering, and the set of positive real numbers.
2.  **Subsets of a Set:** The power set of a set is a lattice where every pair of subsets has a least upper bound (union) and greatest lower bound (intersection).
3.  **Divisibility Relation on Positive Integers:** The divisibility relation on positive integers forms a lattice, where the join operation corresponds to finding the least common multiple (LCM), and the meet operation corresponds to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD).

Lattices are an essential concept in mathematics and computer science, providing a framework for modeling and analyzing various types of data structures.

**Summary of Key Points**

This video provides an overview of the key concepts covered in the current module:

*   **Equivalence Relation:** A binary relation on a set S that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
*   **Partitioning a Set:** An equivalence relation partitions a set into parts where elements within each part are equivalent, while elements across different parts are not related.
*   **Sufficient Condition for Proving Statements:** For a statement to hold true for the entire set S with respect to an equivalence relation R, it is sufficient to prove that the statement holds true for one element in any of these partitions. This simplifies proofs and allows for more efficient reasoning about sets under equivalence relations.
*   **Partial Order Relation:** A binary relation on a set S that satisfies three properties: reflexivity, antisymmetry, and transitivity. Partial order relations impose an order on the elements of the set without requiring every pair to be comparable (total).
*   **Imposition of Order by Partial Orders:** An example is given where an equivalence relation imposes an order on the set {1, 2, 3} based on divisibility: "1 \leq" "12", "18", and "36".
*   **Maximal Element/Minimal Element:** A maximal element in a set S is not less than any other element in the set. Conversely, a minimal element is greater than all other elements.
*   **Lower Bounds/Uper Bounds:** An upper bound of an element x is an element y such that "y ≤" x for every "x", and a lower bound can be defined similarly.

**Key Consequences**

The concepts covered in this module will have significant consequences in computer science:

*   Understanding equivalence relations and their partitions can help simplify proofs about sets under these relationships.
*   Partial order relations can impose meaningful orders on data structures, which is crucial for many applications.

These points provide a solid foundation for further exploration of partial order relations and equivalence relations.
